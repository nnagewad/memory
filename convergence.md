# Convergence
## Problem Statement:
- How might we help millennials remember familial stories they care about?

## Convergence Idea:
- Create a traveling exhibition that lasts for length of 4 months in a city at venues that are designed to host traveling exhibitions.
	- List includes:
		- ROM (Toronto)
		- Victoria & Albert Museum (London)

- Use of the latest and greatest technology that isn't accessible to everyday users
	- Possible sponsorship with a technological firm that is playing around with Augmented reality and has a great collection of data on our everyday lives/likes/dislikes/interests/family/interactions/check-ins.
		- Facebook is an ideal technology partners

- Be interesting to start the exhibit from the top (the surface plane, of us) then we travel down to next portions of the exhibit where we are "digging" deeper to our roots.
	- Inspired by The Mercedes Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

- Associate the use of personal devices for exhibition goers to input their own data and experience. Also beam data to them at certain aspects of the exhibition.
	- Exhibition uses of Augmented Reality inspired by Pok√©mon Go.

## Partnerships
### Facebook
	- Facebook owns **Oculus**
		- [Samsung: Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/)
![Samsung Gear VR](/images/gear-vr_supreme_vr.jpg?raw=true)

	- Also, FaceBook is a software firm where it can create an app specific to the exhibit itself. Also, a large population of the world is on FaceBook, great advertising venture and collection of data indicating anything to do with social aspect of the individual. It can also trace any familial connection.

	- The mobile devices **on loan** will be a demoed version of the device, with limited capability.
		Can't make:
			- Phone calls
			- No camera access
			- Only one app is available (it's of the exhibition)
			- Exhibition visitors cannot modify/customize the phone's software
			- Also, as a security measure, cannot leave the premises with the device.

### ~~[Family History Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_History_Library)~~
- Associated with the church of LDS.

- Probably not a good idea to associate with a specific religious organization.

- Can be limiting especially in countries around the world
