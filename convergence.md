# Convergence
## Problem Statement:
- How might we help millennials remember familial stories they care about?

## Convergence Idea:
- Create an exhibition with the use of the latest and greatest technology
	- Possible sponsorship with a technological firm that is playing around with Augmented reality.

## Partnerships
### Facebook
	- Facebook owns **Oculus**
		- [Samsung: Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/)
![Samsung Gear VR](/images/gear-vr_supreme_vr.jpg?raw=true)

	- Also, FaceBook is a software firm where it can create an app specific to the exhibit itself. Also, a large population of the world is on FaceBook, great advertising venture and collection of data indicating anything to do with social aspect of the individual. It can also trace any familial connection.

	- The mobile devices **on loan** will be a demoed version of the device, with limited capability.
		Can't make:
			- Phone calls
			- No camera access
			- Only one app is available (it's of the exhibition)
			- Exhibition visitors cannot modify/customize the phone's software
			- Also, as a security measure, cannot leave the premises with the device.

### [National Institute for Genealogical Studies](http://www.genealogicalstudies.com/)

### StoryCorps

### ~~[Family History Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_History_Library)~~
- Associated with the church of LDS.

- Probably not a good idea to associate with a specific religious organization.

- Can be limiting especially in countries around the world
