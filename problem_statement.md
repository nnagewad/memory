## Discussion with Ricardo
- **Focus on storytelling**

- **Focus on the source/memory being pure, no alterations.**

	- Demonstrates the project's evolution, and shows the difference over a period of *commits*.

- focus on the act of remembering...

- Millenials have trouble remembering autobiographical memories / not interested

	- Stories, focus on familial stories...
	- Easy to tell stories
