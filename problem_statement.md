# Problem Statement

## Round 1
Memories are frail and can easily be forgotten to the point of non-existence. How do we ensure that memory is preserved for loved-ones and future-generations to access them in times of need, comfort, or as a general reminder of lessons from our past that we shouldn't repeat in our present or our future?

## Feedback
*How might we ensure that future generations continue to practice memory as a tool for comfort, reminder, and storytelling?*
- Ricardo (August 16)

## Research / Response
Collecting artifacts of our present and conducting an act of preservation of that item for archiving:
	- "**The Film Foundation** which is a US-based non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation and the exhibition of restored and classic cinema. It was founded by director Martin Scorsese and several other leading filmmakers in 1990. The foundation raises funds and awareness for film preservation projects and creates educational programs about film."

Technology has become an efficent tool in constructing recollections of our memory:
	- "No one really believes that they will sit down in the future and play back everything they have recorded. That is clearly not the objective. No, the point is that ordinary memory has come to seem inadequate as a register of “life” – whatever that is. Human experience needs to be converted into the inhuman in order for it to be real. If it has not been made digital, it did not happen."
	- "Our social media footprint is an obituary we write ourselves – a set of remembrances we leave for future generations to give strength to this simple, spurious claim: that we lived."

		- **Instagram** captures specific moments in space and time and archives it in memory for future access.

Drawback with relying too heavily on technology in regards to memory:
	- "Humanity increasingly stores its collective knowledge virtually, in the clouds, making it vulnerable to catastrophic loss. But even without a global disaster, memory is at risk. Things we used to remember – quotations, phone numbers – we now outsource to machines"
	- "The speed with which an event becomes old news has deprived us of the time to process experiences, both public and private."

Memory in the digital age and why we should embrace technology:
	- "... [T]wo key things about memory in the digital age. First, that more and more ephemera seems to be kept online – accidentally or otherwise. Second, that memories are becoming increasingly public – social, even."
	- "The web has become an accessible – and often very public – repository for our lives: a place to store memories, to be reminded, and to find other people's memories too. For many people, this shared experience raises questions about the nature of memory. Remembering is often a deeply personal event – do we want to experience it collectively?"
	- "[M]emory has long been stored outside of our own individual bodies, it's just that, increasingly, we are storing it behind small screens rather than on shelves. Before the silicon chip was invented, pen and paper, the printing press and the camera all helped store information for us, ephemerally or for posterity."
		- Transactive Memory
	- "[M]emories aren't just about recalling singular facts, but making connections within a complex network. Why not use technology to help extend and enrich this network?"
	- "[Memories] are mental reconstructions, nifty multimedia collages of how things were, that are shaped by how things are now. Autobiographical memories are stitched together as and when they are needed from information stored in many different neural systems. That makes them curiously susceptible to distortion, and often not nearly as reliable as we would like."

The importance of memory in regards to our future:
	- "Memory is our past and future. To know who you are as a person, you need to have some idea of who you have been. And, for better or worse, your remembered life story is a pretty good guide to what you will do tomorrow. "Our memory is our coherence," wrote the surrealist Spanish-born film-maker, Luis Buñuel, "our reason, our feeling, even our action." Lose your memory and you lose a basic connection with who you are."
	- "[**Autobiographical memory**] is about the narrative we make from the happenings of our own lives."
	- "[**Semantic memory**] which is memory for facts, and other kinds of implicit long-term memory, such as your memory for complex actions such as riding a bike or playing a saxophone."
	- "When we look at how memories are constructed by the brain, the unreliability of memory makes perfect sense. In storyboarding an autobiographical memory, the brain combines fragments of sensory memory with a more abstract knowledge about events, and reassembles them according to the demands of the present. "
	- "How many more of our memories are a story to suit the self? There can be no doubt that our current emotions and beliefs shape the memories that we create. It is hard to remember the political beliefs of our pasts, for example, when so much has changed in the world and in ourselves. How many of us can accurately recall the euphoria at Tony Blair's election in 1997? When our present-day emotions change, so do our memories."
	- "Memory can lead us astray, but then it is a machine with many moving parts, and consequently many things that can go awry. Perhaps even that is the wrong way of looking at it. The great pioneer of memory research, Daniel Schacter, has argued that, even when it is failing, memory is doing exactly the thing it is supposed to do. And that purpose is as much about looking into the future as it is about looking into the past. There is only a limited evolutionary advantage in being able to reminisce about what happened to you, but there is a huge payoff in being able to use that information to work out what is going to happen next. Similar neural systems seem to underpin past-related and future-related thinking. Memory is endlessly creative, and at one level it functions just as imagination does."

Definition of **FlashBulb Memory**:
	- "Modern research has confirmed that memories for emotionally intense situations are unusually vivid and detailed, but it has also shown that they are no more accurate than mundane memories."

# Design Values
1. Memory is multi-faceted:
	- There is one or more ways people will remember events.
		- Respect all viewpoints.

2. Embrace Technological assistance:
	- Technology can help share experiences.
		- Be it to provide evidential support of our story/experience
		- Also the act of retelling of the actual event itself.

3. Memories are reconstructions, they are not accurate recreations:
	- Won't get total accurate accounts, but enough evidence to lay down a basis...
	- Also, "there can be no doubt that our current emotions and beliefs shape the memories that we create."

4. Lessons from our past that can be applied to our future:
	- Memories don't just live in the past, they can help guide our future.


# Notes (Aug. 16)
## Discussion with Jeremy Bailey
Is the preservation of memory actually important?
	- Best way to find out is by talking to 10 people and asking them whether it is an issue.


# Notes (Aug. 17)
## Discussion with Dan Hulton
Is memory worth preserving?
	- Society seems to have this obsession in preservation of memory, but must we accept the fact that memories will fade?
	- Also, is there an interest in regards to our familial history?
		- Does it even matter?

Dan passed along a [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12303225) of efforts in improving memory.

The art of Curating memory
	- What is considered valuable memory?
	- The drawback is the loss of those memories based on the curator's intention/objectives.


## Discussion with Ricardo
- **Focus on storytelling**
- **Focus on the source/memory being pure, no alterations.**
- Ignore:
	- Distorted memory
		- Passed down from one interpretation
	- Curation of memory...
