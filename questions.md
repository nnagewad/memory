- Does location where sharing familial stories/memories matter to you? Do you usually associate a space when you hear/share familal stories?

- What impact does having the actual artifact in your hands help validify the story being told? How would you feel if only a replica of the artifact was available?


## 2b. The Main Content - Exhibitions
### Now if you don't mind, I'll be diverting the questions

- What's your attitude to using electronic devices at an exhibit? Can you recall what you used?

- Have you been to an exhibit where it varies based on location? For example, some of the content is available at one location, while it's available/modified when you revisit the exhibit at a new location (ie. city/country) over a short-period of time?

- Can you provide an example where you have visited an exhibit where you've contributed to it?
